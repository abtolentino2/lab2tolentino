          <p><strong>Hello! I am Anzel Clarenz Tolentino, student from Asia Pacific College. </strong></p>
          <p>
Originally from the city of Pasay. Graduated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics strand on
Senior High School also in Asia Pacific College. My capabilities as a student is not the high caliber type, mainly because
I mostly do what I want to do other than having a fully academical mindset. Some would say that it's mediocre and irresponsible but I disagree,
because I know my limitations and I always believed that it's always important to be balanced. 
By balanced I mean it always depends of which environment I am with. If I was in home I would prioritize my family, If I was around my friend obviously I would socialize
and if I was in school then I would think academically. 
Choosing IT course is one of my biggest risk. Given that my interest in technology is highly curious, Information Technology course is one of the most difficult but in demand in the society, 
by the reason of feeding my curiousity and seeking opportunity I took the biggest risk of my life and now I may be struggling but I know it would be worth it.

In terms of personal life. I do nothing much as a hobby, I'm not sporty despite my physical potential, therefore I'm more likely in front of the computer to entertain myself. Sometimes I read fictional books
when there are no internet or electricity because I like to imagine things out of the words I've red. It's pretty boring to know what I was doing for entertainment but I'm contended on everything that I do.           </p>

	<h2><strong>Reflection 1</strong></h2>
	<p>The first week of class sessions of USERDES class is not that I expected because
although I came in late, I thought our professor would ask me things like why I came in late, but
she’s focused in giving instructions. Therefore, I followed those instructions and as we all do it
further instructions came again which helped and amazed all of us honestly.
At first since the subject talks about user design and interface I thought we’re already
heading for a coding review because given that we’re sophomore students I thought that our
professor would assume that we could start already, good thing that we started smoothly by
having us discuss every possible definition of design. Honestly on my opinion, I always thought
“design” would just involve how a specific thing looks promising to the chosen community, I
thought how things are functioned was out of design’s capability to create. Right now, the way I
think about “design” is quite broad because I now think not just it’s supposed to be visually but
how it is supposed to work, from mechanical to program, the way to think what is necessary for
the design of all things should, and what could be the better and most efficient way to create
such product. After presenting most of the favorite applications, the discussion of us about
design takes place upon analyzing what are the capabilities of each application and what could
be added in a way that it can be better.
This week of USERDES I could say that it gave me additional information from what I
thought I knew before. I was quite impressed that even with just the examples on the board our
professor executes the discussion very well and delivered points where we could understand
better.</p>
	<h2><strong>Reflection 2</strong></h2>
	<p>As for need finding, we had a difficult time conceptualizing what could be fixed or what is
needed. However, before that I always look upon solutions from simple problems not knowing there are
much simpler solutions that can be done.
That’s why upon conceptualizing, our group looked upon other solutions that could get better
with different process and came up with an idea of our initial application. But because it doesn’t
provide that much solution it doesn’t meet our professor’s expectation, and she gave us instructions of
how could our application be effective on the user’s perspective. Through the week, we had difficulties
identifying the problem and the needs of our desired application but in the end, we’ve came up with
some and will get it improved as days pass.
We’ve created an interface of our mobile application in paper, but it doesn’t seem to be final
because we don’t know just yet if we could pull-off such ambition on an interface with our current
knowledge and experience in I.T. but rest assured that we are doing our best to meet that expectation
and focus on our intent on our desired application.</p>
	<h2><strong>Reflection 3</strong></h2>
	<p>I’ve created a web application way too long ago before Miss Jen told us to do so, that’s why everything feels so new when I’m coding in html and css again for a very long time. But upon recalling what it’s like to code in doing a web application it’s fun to experiment once again in coding in html.
Although the web application I’ve created right now is just a basic application without even a function inside of it. I wanted to level it up a little more not just for me to use it but also for the other users to possibly navigate the web app itself. Because initially when opening my newly created web app, it’s so plainly created that it has higher possibility that other users might find it boring. But as long as I can remember all of the learnings I got from the past years of programming, I’m sure I can achieve that navigating worthy web application.
It is quite fun experimenting and creating a web application but as soon as I need to create a specific web app, I need to know when to use a particular function to meet the expectations of the other users that will navigate throughout the web app itself.</p>
    <h2><strong>Reflection 4</strong></h2>
	<p>Userinyerface web application is not the best web application out there but it speaks the importance of having a user-friendly web application in order for the user to navigate easily and properly. Userinyerface on the other hand, is the exact opposite of a user-friendly application because it requires unusual inputs from the user leading them to stall longer from a single page to another.
From my experience, upon entering Userinyerface the color scheme seems to be more contradicting from the text because green means to confirm and the green circle contains a text saying “No” so I think every user might find this unusual and wrong. Also, the direction to get in the next page is quite bothering because the underlined text is not on “here” while most of the redirecting URL does that. Entering the next page which has the form to fill-in, every text box has texts that the user should delete first before entering their desired texts. When the user gets away from the keyboard, there’s a pop-up that will indicate your time and it will not exit til the user closed it, but the thing is the close button is not on the upper-right side but instead it’s on the lower-left spelled with the copyright symbols which confuses me as a user because it is wrong again. Finishing the form will get the user into the terms and conditions but this terms has a very slow scrolling experience, but upon knowing the logic of this web-page I’ve activated the find bar and searched for the word “fast” and found an instruction that to scroll faster I should hold “Alt” button with it. The filling-in the form is the page where I’ve been stalled the most but the rest pages after it was easy for me.
Just by knowing that the application is tricking me, I’ve thought of doing what is not to do properly because everything in this web application is not supposed to be user friendly. On the good side of the story this application just enlightens it user of having a uniformed and complete design that will not led its users to confusion.</p>

		<li><strong>Problem: Smartphones tend to be distractive while learning because of the connectivity it offers. The presence of smartphones affect the focus a student as one tries to check notifications to stay connected from time to time. </li></strong>
		<li><strong>Supporting study: Researchers found that students sending and receiving messages while studying scored lower test results and were less effective at tasks such as note taking. It found that when students did not use mobiles, they were better at being able to recall information. (BBC)</li></strong>
		<p>We could easily place our phones to somewhere out of reach while studying to avoid this kind of distraction. But in this time of digitalization, learning materials are now becoming electronic and most of it can be easily accessed through our mobile phones. This now beats the purpose of placing your phone somewhere else because you now need it for studying. In addition, emergencies are mostly addressed through our phones which is why need it around almost all the time.</p>
		<li><strong>Supporting study: Cell phones give students access to tools and apps that can help them complete and stay on top of their class work. These tools can also teach students to develop better study habits, like time management and organization skills. (Oxford Learning)</strong></li>
		<li><strong>App Solution:	Our group came up with an app idea solution for this problem which is, Study Lock. We find it very helpful to have this kind of app because all of us review our lecture notes in our mobile phones because it’s easier and paperless. Our app’s main feature is the complete lock, which will lock the phone from all of its features excluding emergency call features and partial lock, for selected apps only, for span of time set by the user. Both will be very effective as most people tend to still check their phones even without notification or any alerts receive. This will allow users to have undivided focus during study sessions.</strong></li>
